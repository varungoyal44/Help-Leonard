Create an iOS app targeting either iOS 6.1 or iOS 7. When you are finished with the app, create a pull request to submit your app.

Not all the user stories are required, we understand that you have limited time.

The assumptions and details for the user stories are entirely up to you, add as much detail or as little detail as you like.

Style and design are also entirely up to you, make the entire app in black and white if you want.

If you are unable to finish a user story, add a comment to the pull request explaining how you were planning to code the user story and why you were unable to do it.
